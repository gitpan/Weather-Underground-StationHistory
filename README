Weather-Underground-StationHistory version 0.0.1

This module provides a URL generator function for retrieving historical data
for weather stations from Weather Underground (http://wunderground.com).

Additionally, a function to clean up the data retrieved from said URLs is
provided.  Nominally, the content retrieved from the URLs is in CSV (Comma
Separated Values) format.  If you enter these URLs into a web browser, the data
does appear to be in that format.  However, the MIME type given for the data by
the web server is "text/html" and the data contains <br> tags and HTML comments
(though no <html>, <head>, or <body> tags that you would expect for an HTML
document). Thus, if a user copies and pastes the data from the web browser, the
application receiving the data will get correct CSV, but anything trying to
directly parse the page content as CSV will encounter problems.
