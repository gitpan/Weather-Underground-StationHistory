=head1 NAME

Weather::Underground::StationHistory - Utility functions for dealing with
weather station historical data from L<http://wunderground.com>.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Weather::Underground::StationHistory version 1.0.2.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Weather::Underground::StationHistory qw{ :all };

    use LWP::Simple;

    print
        strip_garbage_from_station_history(
            get(
                generate_single_day_station_history_url(
                    'KILCHICA52',
                    2006,
                    10,
                    27,
                )
            )
        );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a URL generator function for retrieving historical data
for weather stations from Weather Underground (L<http://wunderground.com>).

Additionally, a function to clean up the data retrieved from said URLs is
provided.  Nominally, the content retrieved from the URLs is in CSV (Comma
Separated Values) format.  If you enter these URLs into a web browser, the data
does appear to be in that format.  However, the MIME type given for the data by
the web server is C<text/html> and the data contains C<< <br> >> tags and HTML
comments (though no C<< <html> >>, C<< <head> >>, or C<< <body> >> tags that
you would expect for an HTML document). Thus, if a user copies and pastes the
data from the web browser, the application receiving the data will get correct
CSV, but anything trying to directly parse the page content as CSV will
encounter problems.


=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item generate_single_day_station_history_url($station_id, $year, $month_number, $day_of_month)

Returns the URL to use for retrieving data for the station on the specified
day.

C<$year> needs to be the full year number; two digit years are not supported.

C<$month_number> needs to be in the range 1 to 12.


=item strip_garbage_from_station_history($original_contents)

Takes a string containing the data retrieved from Weather Underground and
returns a string containing the same data, without the standard problematic
content.

Note: this function B<does not> ensure that the data is in valid CSV format.
It merely removes extraneous text that usually causes problems in parsing.

The returned value has lines delimited by whatever your platform translates
C<"\n"> to, which may be different from what Weather Underground is returning.
